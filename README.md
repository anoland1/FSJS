README - Andrew Noland Front End Web Development Project

This is a menu and ordering system for a restaurant/bar

The purpose of this project is to create a system that allows patrons to order food and drinks from their seats without contacting a server.  This will reduce wait times for the customers.  You can "order" an item by clicking it on the menu.

The prices for the menu items also change every few seconds based on what time of day and day of the week it is.  During popular times prices are higher.  Some of the prices are taken out to 3 decimals on the menu in this project solely for demonstration purposes show them changing.

This project uses responsive css, jquery and javascript, and HTML. The most difficult part of the project was designing the price mechanism with Javascript.  I did not plan this to be a web site accessible via the Internet, but I created it this way for purposes of this class.  

The "shopping cart/bar tab" part of the project is not complete because it was outside the scope of this front end development course.  The variable that stores the total price for all orders is not able to carry over between different pages.  I would like to finish this section with node.js in the future.

I am interested in pursuing this project further, and possibly looking to work with someone who is a really skilled coder to turn this into reality.  Please let me know if you know anyone interested.
