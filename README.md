README - Andrew Noland Full Stack JavaScript Development Project

This is a menu and ordering system for a restaurant/bar

The purpose of this project is to create a system that allows patrons to order food and drinks from their seats without contacting a server.  This will reduce wait times for the customers.  You can "order" an item by clicking it on the menu.

The prices for the menu items also change every few seconds based on what time of day and day of the week it is.  During popular times prices are higher.  Some of the prices are taken out to 3 decimals on the menu in this project solely for demonstration purposes to show them changing.

To run this code, download the git repository to your machine, install dependencies, and run mongod as well as nodemon index.js.  Then go to localhost:3030/index.html in Chrome.  I did not test on other browsers and do not know if it works.

You can order items which are added to the database, and then pay for your tab.  This site allows users to edit and delete items from their tab so that it fulfills the CRUD requirements.

This project uses node.js, mongodb, express, handlebars, responsive css, jquery and javascript, and HTML.

I am interested in pursuing this project further, and possibly looking to work with someone who is a really skilled coder to turn this into reality.  Please let me know if you know anyone interested.
